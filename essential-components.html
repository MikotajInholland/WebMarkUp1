            <h2>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h2>
            <p>
                The CPU, often referred to as the brain of the computer, handles all instructions from software and hardware. 
                It processes data and performs calculations, enabling the execution of tasks and running applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Importance:</strong> The CPU significantly impacts your computer's performance, affecting everything from gaming to productivity applications. A faster CPU can process more tasks simultaneously, resulting in a smoother experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>What to Look For:</strong><br>
                When choosing a CPU, consider the number of cores and threads, clock speed (measured in GHz), and compatibility with your motherboard. More cores allow for better multitasking, while higher clock speeds improve performance in single-threaded applications. Additionally, look for CPUs with integrated graphics if you don't plan to use a separate GPU.
            </p>

        <article id="gpu">
            <h2>Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)</h2>
            <p>
                The GPU handles rendering images, videos, and animations, making it essential for gaming and graphic design. 
                It offloads graphical tasks from the CPU, freeing up processing power for other tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Importance:</strong> A dedicated GPU enhances gaming performance, improves visual quality, and accelerates tasks such as video editing and 3D rendering. For gaming, a powerful GPU is crucial to achieving high frame rates and better resolutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>What to Look For:</strong><br>
                When selecting a GPU, consider the memory (VRAM), architecture, and performance benchmarks. VRAM is essential for handling high-resolution textures in games, while the architecture affects performance efficiency. Look for GPUs that meet your gaming or creative needs, and ensure compatibility with your system.

        <article id="ram">
            <h2>Random Access Memory (RAM)</h2>
            <p>
                RAM is the short-term memory of your computer, allowing it to store and access data quickly while performing tasks. 
                It temporarily holds data that the CPU needs to access quickly, facilitating faster operations.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Importance:</strong> The amount of RAM you have influences how many applications you can run simultaneously and affects overall system responsiveness. Insufficient RAM can lead to slow performance and application crashes.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>What to Look For:</strong><br>
                When choosing RAM, consider the capacity (measured in GB) and speed (measured in MT/s(Megatransfers per second)). For gaming and multitasking, 16GB is generally recommended, while speed can enhance performance. Ensure compatibility with your motherboard and look for options with low latency for improved performance.

        <article id="motherboard">
            <h2>Motherboard</h2>
            <p>
                The motherboard is the main circuit board that connects all components of the computer. 
                It houses the CPU, RAM, GPU, and other peripherals, enabling communication between these parts.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Importance:</strong> The motherboard determines the compatibility of components and features available in your build, including the number of expansion slots and connectivity options. A good motherboard is crucial for system stability and performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>What to Look For:</strong><br>
                When selecting a motherboard, consider the chipset, form factor, and features. Ensure it supports your CPU and RAM specifications, and look for features such as M.2 slots for SSDs, USB ports, and PCIe slots for future upgrades.

        <article id="storage">
            <h2>Storage Devices</h2>
            <p>
                Storage devices hold your operating system, applications, and files. 
                There are two main types: Hard Disk Drives (HDDs) and Solid State Drives (SSDs). 
                SSDs are faster, while HDDs offer larger storage capacities at a lower price.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Importance:</strong> The type and speed of storage impact boot times, application loading, and file transfer speeds. An SSD can dramatically improve system responsiveness compared to traditional HDDs.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>What to Look For:</strong><br>
                When choosing storage, consider the capacity, speed (measured in MB/s), and whether you want SSD or HDD. For optimal performance, a combination of both is often recommended: an SSD for the operating system and frequently used applications, and an HDD for additional storage.

        <article id="psu">
            <h2>Power Supply Unit (PSU)</h2>
            <p>
                The PSU converts electricity from your wall outlet into usable power for your computer. 
                It supplies power to all components, ensuring stable operation.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Importance:</strong> A high-quality PSU is essential for system stability and longevity. Insufficient or unreliable power can lead to hardware failures and reduced performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>What to Look For:</strong><br>
                When selecting a PSU, consider the wattage, efficiency rating (80 Plus certification), and modularity. Ensure the wattage meets or exceeds your system's power requirements, and opt for a PSU with a high efficiency rating to save on energy costs.
